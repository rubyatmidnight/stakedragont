# stakedragont
python script to randomly generate and input bets on dragon tower



# usage

open the dragon tower page, set it on expert at whatever bet you want
hit play

in a command prompt window or powershell, navigate to the folder and run
`py dragontower.py`
it will ask how many steps up you wish to go; 2 or 3 is good for testing.

once set, tab into the page, and hit enter to start. it will be using your keyboard to hit the hotkeys, so it needs to stay focused and you can't really leave the page yet, sorry. 





requirements:

`pip install keyboard`

`pip install time`

etc
